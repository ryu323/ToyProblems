/**
 * Shuffle Deck
 *
 * Given an array containing a deck of cards, implement a function that shuffles the deck.
 * Note:
 * A shuffled deck should be completely random.
 * That means that a given card should be as likely as any other to appear in a given deck index,
 * completely independent of the order of the input deck.
 * Think carefully about how to be sure your algorithm generates a properly shuffled deck
 * â€“ it is easy to accidentally create a biased algorithm.
